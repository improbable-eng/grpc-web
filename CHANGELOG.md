See related docs for the in-process proxy [here](https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web/tree/0ce3b686ebd74ae0e4b494d0f983328eb7a900e6/go/grpcweb#func--withwebsocketoriginfunc) and for the standalone grpcwebproxy [here](https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web/tree/0ce3b686ebd74ae0e4b494d0f983328eb7a900e6/go/grpcwebproxy#configuring-cors-for-http-and-websocket-connections).

### Other Changes

## 0.8.0
### Breaking Changes
* Scoped npm package under the @improbable-eng org; consumers should now `npm install @improbable-eng/grpc-web`.

## 0.7.0
### Breaking Changes
* Removed built-in support for NodeJS Environments; if you want to use `grpc-web-client` in a NodeJS environment you will need to import `grpc-web-node-http-transport` and specify it as your Default Transport.
* The `transport` property passed to `unary()`, `invoke()` and `client()` should now be an instance of the `Transport` interface (was a reference to a factory function which returned a `Transport` instance), see [#265](https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web/pull/265) for details.

### Other Changes
* Client: Added `grpc.setDefaultTransport()` which can be used to specify which Transport is used when none is specified with the request. [@jonny-improbable](https://github.com/jonny-improbable) in [#265](https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web/pull/265)
